# project-001-100-days-of-code
##This is the starting project for 100 days of code during my sabbatical 
-I was employeed over the last year as an interactive designer and hopped back into dev work for the first time in 5 years.
-This is a way for me to review basic concepts, learn new frameworks, and work on code everyday as I take a break get time
regenerate with my partner. 
##The structure of this ongoing series of projects is to start with basic concepts and projects and incrementally ramp up 
to more complex ones.
